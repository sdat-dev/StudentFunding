As part of that effort, PHY strongly encourages meaningful actions that increase the awareness and participation by historically underrepresented groups - including, but not limited to Blacks and African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders, women, and persons with disabilities - in all fields of research supported by the Division of Physics. To that end, this Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) encourages Principal Investigators (PIs) with active PHY awards to seek opportunities to better engage students from underrepresented groups and discusses ways in which supplements to existing awards can be used to support such efforts. The NSF offers a number of opportunities for PIs to request supplements to enhance research and education opportunities for students. This DCL describes how some of these existing opportunities may be utilized in the interest of promoting the participation of underrepresented groups, as well as new, additional options the Division is offering. These opportunities are available through the disciplinary research programs. The opportunities highlighted through this DCL do not apply to Instrumentation acquisition awards, REU Sites, or large awards made via the use of a cooperative agreement (e.g., facilities, institutes, and centers). In addition to the support of undergraduate and graduate students discussed in this DCL, PIs who identify other ways in which a supplement to an existing award could foster wider participation by members of underrepresented groups are encouraged to contact their cognizant Program Officer (PO). PIs may also utilize other NSF-wide supplement opportunities as a path for encouraging participation by students from underrepresented groups. For example, PHY currently provides supplemental support for veterans under NSF 20-097 \"DCL: MPS Graduate Research Supplement for Veterans (MPS-GRSV).\" Another example is \"Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities (FASED),\" as described in Chapter II.E.6 of the NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide (PAPPG).

The Board recognizes that this amount of money is not sufficient usually to cover the costs of a large research study, particularly one that may involve a large number of subjects or a longitudinal design. Hence, the Board encourages applicants to consider feasibility of their request, that is, what they can achieve for this amount of money, and also to think about this type of award as supporting the beginning stages of a research project, the gathering of pilot data, or the refinement of design and methods. Successful pilot projects will be encouraged to apply for a second year of funding, with the possibility that a higher funding level may be available.</p>","total_funding_limit":20000,"img_url":"https://sdat-dev.github.io/resources/studentfunding/assets/logos-funding-opportunities/apa.png"},{"applicant_type":["Researcher or Investigator","Masters Student","Senior Faculty Member","Faculty Member","Doctoral or Terminal Degree Student","Postdoctoral"],"contact":null,"contact_email":"funding@ngs.org","contact_tel":"202-857-7000","deadline_date":["11-Apr-2024"],"deadline_note":"<p>Grant proposal submissions are due by 11:59 p.m. EDT on April 11, 2024.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","eligibility":"<p>Eligibility Criteria</p><ul><li>Applicants must be 18 or older to apply for a National Geographic Society grant.</li><li>Project start dates should be a minimum of six months after the submission deadline to ensure any awarded funds are received in time.</li><li>If an applicant is working on a project outside their home country or community, they must include at least one local collaborator on the team who is significantly involved in the project.</li><li>Applicants may submit a proposal as the project leader for only one project at a time.</li><li>Applicants must submit a final report and media from any previous National Geographic Society grants for which the applicant was the leader before applying to lead a new project.</li><li>The individual responsible for carrying out the project should write the application and be listed as the project leader.</li></ul><p>Level I Funding specific eligibility:</p><p>Applicants who have not yet received a grant from the National Geographic Society, are working to establish themselves further in their field, hope to gain more experience leading projects, and are interested in joining the National Geographic Explorer community, may apply for a Level I Grant for one-year long projects.</p>","id":"000924","NextDeadlineDate":"11-Apr-2024","programurl":"https://www.nationalgeographic.org/society/grants-and-investments/","prog_title":"Grants Program -- Level I Funding","revision_date":"04-Aug-2023","sponsor_type":"Professional/Academic Assoc &amp; Soc.","sponwebsite":"https://www.nationalgeographic.org/society/","spon_name":"National Geographic Society","synopsis":"<p>The National Geographic Society's Grants Program provides seed funding and support to early career individuals who are working to address critical challenges, advance new solutions, and inspire positive transformation across all seven continents.

In spite of tremendous advancements in scientific research, information, educational and research opportunities are not equally available to all. NIH encourages institutions to diversify their student, postdoctorate and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups identified as underrepresented in the biomedical sciences (e.g., see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html\">Notice of NIH's of Interest in Diversity</a>).

These two aspects should be of roughly the same quality as those of other trainees at the same level who were awarded T32 slots in a particular program. The overall individual training plan, including coursework, research experiences, and the opportunity to build career skills needed for independent research, will be evaluated for its ability to provide the complementary and integrative health practitioner candidate with opportunities to become part of the broader scientific community and develop into an independent and productive research scientist. The research plan will be evaluated for: 1.) Its fit with the mission priorities of NCCIH; 2.) Its fit with the complementary and integrative health practitioner candidate&rsquo;s stated career goals and future plans; and 3.)

Are the program&rsquo;s T32 slots consistently filled with high quality trainees?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">2.

The progress and plans of the candidate should be explained in a paragraph or two of text in the body of the progress report. The stipends for these complementary and integrative health practitioner slots should not be included in the budget pages for the Type 5 application because these funds will be awarded as a supplement each year. Instead, a separate budget page for the complementary and integrative health practitioner candidate should be included in the progress report.
