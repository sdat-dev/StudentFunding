As part of that effort, PHY strongly encourages meaningful actions that increase the awareness and participation by historically underrepresented groups - including, but not limited to Blacks and African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders, women, and persons with disabilities - in all fields of research supported by the Division of Physics. To that end, this Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) encourages Principal Investigators (PIs) with active PHY awards to seek opportunities to better engage students from underrepresented groups and discusses ways in which supplements to existing awards can be used to support such efforts. The NSF offers a number of opportunities for PIs to request supplements to enhance research and education opportunities for students. This DCL describes how some of these existing opportunities may be utilized in the interest of promoting the participation of underrepresented groups, as well as new, additional options the Division is offering. These opportunities are available through the disciplinary research programs. The opportunities highlighted through this DCL do not apply to Instrumentation acquisition awards, REU Sites, or large awards made via the use of a cooperative agreement (e.g., facilities, institutes, and centers). In addition to the support of undergraduate and graduate students discussed in this DCL, PIs who identify other ways in which a supplement to an existing award could foster wider participation by members of underrepresented groups are encouraged to contact their cognizant Program Officer (PO). PIs may also utilize other NSF-wide supplement opportunities as a path for encouraging participation by students from underrepresented groups. For example, PHY currently provides supplemental support for veterans under NSF 20-097 \"DCL: MPS Graduate Research Supplement for Veterans (MPS-GRSV).\" Another example is \"Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities (FASED),\" as described in Chapter II.E.6 of the NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide (PAPPG).

For the K00 phase of the award, the U.S. institution at which the K00 phase of the award will be conducted is responsible for determining and documenting, in the transition application, that the PD/PI's visa will allow the PD/PI to remain in the U.S. for the duration of the K00 award.

Fostering diversity by addressing underrepresentation in the scientific research workforce is a key component of the NIH strategy to identify, develop, support and maintain the quality of our scientific human capital. In spite of tremendous advancements in scientific research, information, educational and research opportunities are not equally available to all. NIH encourages institutions to diversify their student, postdoctorate and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups identified as underrepresented in the biomedical sciences (e.g., see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html\">Notice of NIH's of Interest in Diversity</a>). For the purpose of this announcement, institutions are strongly encouraged to identify candidates who will enhance diversity on a national basis. In addition, it is recognized that underrepresentation can vary from setting to setting; individuals from racial or ethnic groups that can be demonstrated convincingly to be underrepresented by the grantee institution should be encouraged to participate in this program.</span></span></span></span></p></div></span><span style=\"color:#333333;font-size:small;\"><strong><br /></strong></span></div><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"></span>","id":"112701","NextDeadlineDate":"31-Jan-2024","programurl":"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-22-220.html","prog_title":"Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP)(R25 - Independent Clinical Trial Not Allowed)","revision_date":"22-Nov-2022","sponsor_type":"US Federal","sponwebsite":null,"spon_name":"National Institute of General Medical Sciences/NIH/DHHS","synopsis":"<div data-index=\"14\"><div><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">The NIH Research Education Program (R25) supports research education activities in the mission areas of the NIH.&nbsp; The overarching goal of this&nbsp;R25 program is to support educational activities that encourage individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from groups underrepresented in the biomedical and behavioral sciences, to pursue further studies or careers in research&nbsp;</span></p></div></div><div data-index=\"15\"><div tabindex=\"0\" data-element-id=\"119514\" data-element-required=\"true\" data-element-has-value=\"true\" data-section-code=\"OI\" data-element-type=\"TEXT\"></div><div><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">To accomplish the stated over-arching goal, this FOA will support creative educational activities with a primary focus on:</span></p></div></div><div data-index=\"16\"><div tabindex=\"0\" data-element-id=\"119515\" data-element-required=\"true\" data-element-has-value=\"true\" data-section-code=\"OI\" data-element-type=\"CHECKBOX\"></div><div><ul><li><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><strong><em>Courses for Skills Development</em></strong></span></li></ul><ul><li><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><strong><em>Research Experiences</em></strong></span></li></ul></div></div><div data-index=\"17\"><div tabindex=\"0\" data-element-id=\"119516\" data-element-required=\"false\" data-element-has-value=\"true\" data-section-code=\"OI\" data-element-type=\"TEXT\"></div><div><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) provides support to eligible, domestic institutions to develop and implement effective, evidence-informed approaches to biomedical research education and mentoring that will keep pace with the rapid evolution of the research enterprise.

This program requires strong partnerships between at least two post-secondary educational institutions offering science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) degrees. At least one partner must be an institution that offers the associate degree as the highest STEM degree and the other partner(s) must offer baccalaureate degrees in biomedically relevant STEM fields.

Their potential to develop as an independent and productive researcher in biomedical, behavioral, or clinical science, as demonstrated in the training plan. These two aspects should be of roughly the same quality as those of other trainees at the same level who were awarded T32 slots in a particular program. The overall individual training plan, including coursework, research experiences, and the opportunity to build career skills needed for independent research, will be evaluated for its ability to provide the complementary and integrative health practitioner candidate with opportunities to become part of the broader scientific community and develop into an independent and productive research scientist. The research plan will be evaluated for: 1.) Its fit with the mission priorities of NCCIH; 2.) Its fit with the complementary and integrative health practitioner candidate&rsquo;s stated career goals and future plans; and 3.)

Are the program&rsquo;s T32 slots consistently filled with high quality trainees?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">2.

The stipends for these complementary and integrative health practitioner slots should not be included in the budget pages for the Type 5 application because these funds will be awarded as a supplement each year. Instead, a separate budget page for the complementary and integrative health practitioner candidate should be included in the progress report.
