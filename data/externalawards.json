As part of that effort, PHY strongly encourages meaningful actions that increase the awareness and participation by historically underrepresented groups - including, but not limited to Blacks and African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders, women, and persons with disabilities - in all fields of research supported by the Division of Physics. To that end, this Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) encourages Principal Investigators (PIs) with active PHY awards to seek opportunities to better engage students from underrepresented groups and discusses ways in which supplements to existing awards can be used to support such efforts. The NSF offers a number of opportunities for PIs to request supplements to enhance research and education opportunities for students. This DCL describes how some of these existing opportunities may be utilized in the interest of promoting the participation of underrepresented groups, as well as new, additional options the Division is offering. These opportunities are available through the disciplinary research programs. The opportunities highlighted through this DCL do not apply to Instrumentation acquisition awards, REU Sites, or large awards made via the use of a cooperative agreement (e.g., facilities, institutes, and centers). In addition to the support of undergraduate and graduate students discussed in this DCL, PIs who identify other ways in which a supplement to an existing award could foster wider participation by members of underrepresented groups are encouraged to contact their cognizant Program Officer (PO).

Fostering diversity by addressing underrepresentation in the scientific research workforce is a key component of the NIH strategy to identify, develop, support and maintain the quality of our scientific human capital. In spite of tremendous advancements in scientific research, information, educational and research opportunities are not equally available to all. NIH encourages institutions to diversify their student, postdoctorate and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups identified as underrepresented in the biomedical sciences (e.g., see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html\">Notice of NIH's of Interest in Diversity</a>). For the purpose of this announcement, institutions are strongly encouraged to identify candidates who will enhance diversity on a national basis. In addition, it is recognized that underrepresentation can vary from setting to setting; individuals from racial or ethnic groups that can be demonstrated convincingly to be underrepresented by the grantee institution should be encouraged to participate in this program.</span></span></p></div><strong></strong></span><span style=\"color:#333333;font-size:small;\"><strong><br /></strong></span></div><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"></span>","id":"112701","NextDeadlineDate":"31-Jan-2023","programurl":"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-22-220.html","prog_title":"Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP)(R25 - Independent Clinical Trial Not Allowed)","revision_date":"02-Aug-2022","sponsor_type":"US Federal","sponwebsite":null,"spon_name":"National Institute of General Medical Sciences/NIH/DHHS","synopsis":"<div data-index=\"14\"><div><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">The NIH Research Education Program (R25) supports research education activities in the mission areas of the NIH.&nbsp; The overarching goal of this&nbsp;R25 program is to support educational activities that encourage individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from groups underrepresented in the biomedical and behavioral sciences, to pursue further studies or careers in research&nbsp;</span></p></div></div><div data-index=\"15\"><div tabindex=\"0\" data-element-id=\"119514\" data-element-required=\"true\" data-element-has-value=\"true\" data-section-code=\"OI\" data-element-type=\"TEXT\"></div><div><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">To accomplish the stated over-arching goal, this FOA will support creative educational activities with a primary focus on:</span></p></div></div><div data-index=\"16\"><div tabindex=\"0\" data-element-id=\"119515\" data-element-required=\"true\" data-element-has-value=\"true\" data-section-code=\"OI\" data-element-type=\"CHECKBOX\"></div><div><ul><li><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><strong><em>Courses for Skills Development</em></strong></span></li></ul><ul><li><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><strong><em>Research Experiences</em></strong></span></li></ul></div></div><div data-index=\"17\"><div tabindex=\"0\" data-element-id=\"119516\" data-element-required=\"false\" data-element-has-value=\"true\" data-section-code=\"OI\" data-element-type=\"TEXT\"></div><div><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) provides support to eligible, domestic institutions to develop and implement effective, evidence-informed approaches to biomedical research education and mentoring that will keep pace with the rapid evolution of the research enterprise.

The sponsoring institution must have staff and facilities available on site to provide a suitable environment for performing high-quality research training. The training should occur in an environment that has appropriate human and technical resources and is demonstrably committed to training in the field(s) proposed by the applicant. The sponsoring institution may be private (profit or nonprofit) or public, including the NIH Intramural Programs and other Federal laboratories. All institutions with the appropriate resources and commitment are encouraged to apply. An individual may request support for training abroad. In such cases, the candidate is required to provide detailed justification for the foreign training, including the reasons why the facilities, the sponsor, or other aspects of the proposed experience are more appropriate than training in a domestic setting. The justification is evaluated in terms of the scientific advantages of the foreign training as compared to the training available domestically. Foreign training will be considered for funding only when the scientific advantages are clear.</span></p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;margin-bottom:10px;color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13.6px;background-color:#ffffff;\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;color:#000000;\">The Kirschstein-NRSA F32 fellowship is designed to support research training experiences in new settings in order to maximize the acquisition of new skills and knowledge. In most cases, therefore, the sponsoring institution should be a site other than where the candidate trained as a graduate student. However, if the candidate is proposing postdoctoral training at his/her doctoral institution, the application must carefully document the opportunities for new research training experiences specifically designed to broaden his/her scientific background and to acquire new knowledge and/or technical skills that will enhance his/her potential to become a productive, independent investigator. Applications that propose postdoctoral experiences in the same lab, in fundamentally the same research environment or with the same primary mentor who supported the candidate's predoctoral experience, are inconsistent with the intent of this F32 program.</span></p><div class=\"heading4\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em;color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;background-color:#ffffff;\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;color:#000000;\">Foreign Institutions</span></div><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;margin-bottom:10px;color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13.6px;background-color:#ffffff;\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Non-domestic (non-U.S.) Entities (Foreign Institutions)&nbsp;<strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;\">are&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;eligible to apply.</span></span></span><br style=\"box-sizing:border-box;\" /><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Non-domestic (non-U.S.) components of U.S. Organizations&nbsp;<strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;\">are</strong>&nbsp;eligible to apply.</span></span></span><br style=\"box-sizing:border-box;\" /><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;color:#000000;\">Foreign components, as&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11118\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;color:#428bca;text-decoration-line:none;\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">defined in the&nbsp;<em style=\"box-sizing:border-box;\">NIH Grants Policy Statement</em></span></span></span></a><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">,&nbsp;<strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;\">are&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;allowed.</span></span></span></p><div class=\"heading4\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em;color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;background-color:#ffffff;\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;color:#000000;\">Required Registrations</span></div><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;margin-bottom:10px;color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13.6px;background-color:#ffffff;\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;color:#000000;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;\">Applicant Organizations</strong></span></p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;margin-bottom:10px;color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13.6px;background-color:#ffffff;\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Applicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the SF 424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award.

Applications are encouraged in any research area that is aligned with the BRAIN Initiative, including neuroethics. Applicants are expected to propose research training in an area that clearly complements their predoctoral research. Formal training in analytical tools appropriate for the proposed research is expected to be an integral component of the research training plan.

The quality of their academic record (if predoctoral) and prior research experience and productivity; and 2.) Their potential to develop as an independent and productive researcher in biomedical, behavioral, or clinical science, as demonstrated in the training plan. These two aspects should be of roughly the same quality as those of other trainees at the same level who were awarded T32 slots in a particular program. The overall individual training plan, including coursework, research experiences, and the opportunity to build career skills needed for independent research, will be evaluated for its ability to provide the complementary and integrative health practitioner candidate with opportunities to become part of the broader scientific community and develop into an independent and productive research scientist. The research plan will be evaluated for: 1.) Its fit with the mission priorities of NCCIH; 2.) Its fit with the complementary and integrative health practitioner candidate&rsquo;s stated career goals and future plans; and 3.) Its consistency with the complementary and integrative health practitioner candidate&rsquo;s stage of research development.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><strong>Additional Criteria for Selection</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">Due to budget constraints, only a very limited number of T32 complementary and integrative health practitioner Supplement slots will be awarded in a given fiscal year. NCCIH program staff will evaluate the applications using the requested materials and evaluation process described above, in addition to the following criteria:</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">1. Are the program&rsquo;s T32 slots consistently filled with high quality trainees?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">2. Does the T32 program have an outstanding overall record of training predoctoral and/or postdoctoral trainees for successful research careers?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">After review by NCCIH program staff, the T32 PI will be notified of the funding decision. If funding is approved, a supplemental Notice of Award will be issued by Grants Management. The complementary and integrative health practitioner supplemental slot will be administered in the same manner as other positions on the training grant.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><strong>Reporting Requirements</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">Progress for complementary and integrative health practitioner trainees supported via this mechanism must be reported in the same way as all other trainees in a Type 5 non-competing continuation application each year that the supplement is needed. The progress and plans of the candidate should be explained in a paragraph or two of text in the body of the progress report. The stipends for these complementary and integrative health practitioner slots should not be included in the budget pages for the Type 5 application because these funds will be awarded as a supplement each year. Instead, a separate budget page for the complementary and integrative health practitioner candidate should be included in the progress report.
