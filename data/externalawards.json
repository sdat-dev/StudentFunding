As part of that effort, PHY strongly encourages meaningful actions that increase the awareness and participation by historically underrepresented groups - including, but not limited to Blacks and African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders, women, and persons with disabilities - in all fields of research supported by the Division of Physics. To that end, this Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) encourages Principal Investigators (PIs) with active PHY awards to seek opportunities to better engage students from underrepresented groups and discusses ways in which supplements to existing awards can be used to support such efforts. The NSF offers a number of opportunities for PIs to request supplements to enhance research and education opportunities for students. This DCL describes how some of these existing opportunities may be utilized in the interest of promoting the participation of underrepresented groups, as well as new, additional options the Division is offering. These opportunities are available through the disciplinary research programs. The opportunities highlighted through this DCL do not apply to Instrumentation acquisition awards, REU Sites, or large awards made via the use of a cooperative agreement (e.g., facilities, institutes, and centers). In addition to the support of undergraduate and graduate students discussed in this DCL, PIs who identify other ways in which a supplement to an existing award could foster wider participation by members of underrepresented groups are encouraged to contact their cognizant Program Officer (PO). PIs may also utilize other NSF-wide supplement opportunities as a path for encouraging participation by students from underrepresented groups. For example, PHY currently provides supplemental support for veterans under NSF 20-097 \"DCL: MPS Graduate Research Supplement for Veterans (MPS-GRSV).\" Another example is \"Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities (FASED),\" as described in Chapter II.E.6 of the NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide (PAPPG). Funding of supplements described in this DCL is subject to the availability of funds.","total_funding_limit":60000,"img_url":"https://sdat-dev.github.io/resources/studentfunding/assets/logos-funding-opportunities/dfmapsn.png"},{"applicant_type":["Undergraduate Student"],"contact":"Mrs. Rachel Eustace","contact_email":"Rachel@pathologists.org.uk","contact_tel":"01273 775700","deadline_date":null,"deadline_note":"Applications for a 2022 ACP Student Research Fund Award can be submitted at any time.","eligibility":"<p>The ACP Student Research Fund is open to applications from undergraduate medical students (sponsored by ACP members if possible). <br /></p>","id":"019638","NextDeadlineDate":null,"programurl":"https://pathologists.org.uk/awards/acp-student-research-fund-2021/","prog_title":"Student Research Fund Award","revision_date":"05-May-2022","sponsor_type":"Miscellaneous Non-Federal","sponwebsite":"https://pathologists.org.uk/awards/","spon_name":"Association of Clinical Pathologists","synopsis":"<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"></span>The Association of Clinical Pathologists is keen to encourage undergraduates to undertake some research within laboratory medicine, to raise the profile of laboratory medicine within the minds of undergraduates and to aid in recruitment of young graduates.&nbsp;Nine awards of up to &pound;5,000 are available, and priority will be given to those seeking funding to support an intercalated degree.<span style=\"color:#212529;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:small;font-style:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:#ffffff;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial;display:inline !important;float:none;\"></span></p>","total_funding_limit":5550,"img_url":"https://sdat-dev.github.io/resources/studentfunding/assets/logos-funding-opportunities/aocp.png"},{"applicant_type":["Doctoral or Terminal Degree Student","Masters Student"],"contact":null,"contact_email":"apadiv38.studentawards@gmail.com","contact_tel":"804-752-4987","deadline_date":["15-Jan-2023"],"deadline_note":"Proposals will be reviewed on an annual basis and must be received by January 15, with notification of award made in late March.","eligibility":"<div>The award competition is open to full-time students enrolled in any degree conferring-graduate program in psychology.

In spite of tremendous advancements in scientific research, information, educational and research opportunities are not equally available to all. NIH encourages institutions to diversify their student, postdoctorate and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups identified as underrepresented in the biomedical sciences (e.g., see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html\">Notice of NIH's of Interest in Diversity</a>).

Applications that propose postdoctoral experiences in the same lab, in fundamentally the same research environment or with the same primary mentor who supported the candidate's predoctoral experience, are inconsistent with the intent of this F32 program.</span></p><div class=\"heading4\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em;color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;background-color:#ffffff;\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;color:#000000;\">Foreign Institutions</span></div><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;margin-bottom:10px;color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13.6px;background-color:#ffffff;\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Non-domestic (non-U.S.) Entities (Foreign Institutions)&nbsp;<strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;\">are&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;eligible to apply.</span></span></span><br style=\"box-sizing:border-box;\" /><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Non-domestic (non-U.S.) components of U.S. Organizations&nbsp;<strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;\">are</strong>&nbsp;eligible to apply.</span></span></span><br style=\"box-sizing:border-box;\" /><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;color:#000000;\">Foreign components, as&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11118\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;color:#428bca;text-decoration-line:none;\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">defined in the&nbsp;<em style=\"box-sizing:border-box;\">NIH Grants Policy Statement</em></span></span></span></a><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">,&nbsp;<strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;\">are&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;allowed.</span></span></span></p><div class=\"heading4\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em;color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;background-color:#ffffff;\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;color:#000000;\">Required Registrations</span></div><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;margin-bottom:10px;color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13.6px;background-color:#ffffff;\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;color:#000000;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;\">Applicant Organizations</strong></span></p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;margin-bottom:10px;color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13.6px;background-color:#ffffff;\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Applicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the SF 424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award.

Applications are encouraged in any research area that is aligned with the BRAIN Initiative, including neuroethics. Applicants are expected to propose research training in an area that clearly complements their predoctoral research. Formal training in analytical tools appropriate for the proposed research is expected to be an integral component of the research training plan. In order to maximize the training potential of the F32 award, this program encourages applications from individuals who have not yet completed their terminal doctoral degree and who expect to do so within 12 months of the application due date. On the application due date, candidates may not have completed more than 12 months of postdoctoral training.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><em style=\"box-sizing:border-box;color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13.6px;background-color:#ffffff;\">This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) does not allow applicants to propose to lead an independent clinical trial, but does allow applicants to&nbsp;</em></span><span style=\"color:#333333;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;background-color:#ffffff;\">propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a sponsor or co-sponsor</span><em style=\"box-sizing:border-box;color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13.6px;background-color:#ffffff;\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">.</span></em>","total_funding_limit":0,"img_url":"https://sdat-dev.github.io/resources/studentfunding/assets/logos-funding-opportunities/niomhnd.png"},{"applicant_type":["Faculty Member","Non-Profit Organization","Hospital","Doctoral or Terminal Degree Student","Indian Tribe or Governing Organization","Physician or Medical Professional","Postdoctoral","For-Profit Organization","Researcher or Investigator","State/Local Governing Organization","Community Service Organization","Research Institution or Organization","Small Business","Historically Black College or University (HBCU)","501(c)(3) Tax-exempt","Minority Institution or Organization","College or University","Laboratory"],"contact":"Lanay Mudd, Ph.D.","contact_email":"Lanay.mudd@nih.gov","contact_tel":"301-594-93466","deadline_date":["02-Jan-2023","03-Jul-2023","02-Jan-2024","01-Jul-2024"],"deadline_note":"Application Due Dates: January 3, 2022; July 1, 2022; January 2, 2023; July 3, 2023; January 2, 2024; and July 1, 2024; by 5:00 pm local time of applicant organization","eligibility":"<span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"></span><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13.6px;background-color:#ffffff;\"><div data-element-id=\"17882\" data-element-has-label=\"false\" data-element-required=\"true\" data-element-has-value=\"true\" data-section-code=\"OI\" data-element-type=\"TEXT\"><p><strong><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">T32 Program Eligibility for a Predoctoral or Postdoctoral&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><strong>Complementary and Integrative Health Practitioner Supplement</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">Programs must email their NCCIH program officer to confirm their eligibility prior to applying.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">&bull; The T32 program must have at least 1 year of funding remaining at the time of the supplement award.

The quality of their academic record (if predoctoral) and prior research experience and productivity; and 2.) Their potential to develop as an independent and productive researcher in biomedical, behavioral, or clinical science, as demonstrated in the training plan. These two aspects should be of roughly the same quality as those of other trainees at the same level who were awarded T32 slots in a particular program. The overall individual training plan, including coursework, research experiences, and the opportunity to build career skills needed for independent research, will be evaluated for its ability to provide the complementary and integrative health practitioner candidate with opportunities to become part of the broader scientific community and develop into an independent and productive research scientist. The research plan will be evaluated for: 1.) Its fit with the mission priorities of NCCIH; 2.) Its fit with the complementary and integrative health practitioner candidate&rsquo;s stated career goals and future plans; and 3.) Its consistency with the complementary and integrative health practitioner candidate&rsquo;s stage of research development.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><strong>Additional Criteria for Selection</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">Due to budget constraints, only a very limited number of T32 complementary and integrative health practitioner Supplement slots will be awarded in a given fiscal year. NCCIH program staff will evaluate the applications using the requested materials and evaluation process described above, in addition to the following criteria:</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">1. Are the program&rsquo;s T32 slots consistently filled with high quality trainees?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">2. Does the T32 program have an outstanding overall record of training predoctoral and/or postdoctoral trainees for successful research careers?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">After review by NCCIH program staff, the T32 PI will be notified of the funding decision. If funding is approved, a supplemental Notice of Award will be issued by Grants Management. The complementary and integrative health practitioner supplemental slot will be administered in the same manner as other positions on the training grant.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><strong>Reporting Requirements</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">Progress for complementary and integrative health practitioner trainees supported via this mechanism must be reported in the same way as all other trainees in a Type 5 non-competing continuation application each year that the supplement is needed. The progress and plans of the candidate should be explained in a paragraph or two of text in the body of the progress report. The stipends for these complementary and integrative health practitioner slots should not be included in the budget pages for the Type 5 application because these funds will be awarded as a supplement each year. Instead, a separate budget page for the complementary and integrative health practitioner candidate should be included in the progress report. An individual supported by a complementary and integrative health practitioner supplement slot must be included in the usual reporting tables required for renewal (Type 2) as well as non-competing continuation (Type 5) applications.</span></p></div><div data-element-id=\"17883\" data-element-has-label=\"false\" data-element-required=\"true\" data-element-has-value=\"true\" data-section-code=\"OI\" data-element-type=\"TEXT\"><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">Description of circumstances for which administrative supplements are available.</span></p></div><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">All requests for supplemental slots should be preceded by consultation with NCCIH program staff to determine availability of funds and to ascertain the suitability of the candidate.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><strong>Application and Submission Information</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">Applications for this initiative must be submitted using the following opportunity or its subsequent reissued equivalent.</span></p><ul><li><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\"><a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-20-272.html\">PA-20-272</a>&nbsp;- Administrative Supplements to Existing NIH Grants and Cooperative Agreements (Parent Admin Supp Clinical Trial Optional)</span></span></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">All instructions in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide.html\">SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-20-272.html\">PA-20-272</a>&nbsp;must be followed, with the following additions:</span></span></p><ul><li><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">For funding consideration, applicants must include &ldquo;NOT-AT-21-014&rdquo; (without quotation marks) in the Agency Routing Identifier field (box 4B) of the SF424 R&amp;R form.
