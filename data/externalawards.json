As part of that effort, PHY strongly encourages meaningful actions that increase the awareness and participation by historically underrepresented groups - including, but not limited to Blacks and African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders, women, and persons with disabilities - in all fields of research supported by the Division of Physics. To that end, this Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) encourages Principal Investigators (PIs) with active PHY awards to seek opportunities to better engage students from underrepresented groups and discusses ways in which supplements to existing awards can be used to support such efforts. The NSF offers a number of opportunities for PIs to request supplements to enhance research and education opportunities for students. This DCL describes how some of these existing opportunities may be utilized in the interest of promoting the participation of underrepresented groups, as well as new, additional options the Division is offering. These opportunities are available through the disciplinary research programs. The opportunities highlighted through this DCL do not apply to Instrumentation acquisition awards, REU Sites, or large awards made via the use of a cooperative agreement (e.g., facilities, institutes, and centers). In addition to the support of undergraduate and graduate students discussed in this DCL, PIs who identify other ways in which a supplement to an existing award could foster wider participation by members of underrepresented groups are encouraged to contact their cognizant Program Officer (PO). PIs may also utilize other NSF-wide supplement opportunities as a path for encouraging participation by students from underrepresented groups. For example, PHY currently provides supplemental support for veterans under NSF 20-097 \"DCL: MPS Graduate Research Supplement for Veterans (MPS-GRSV).\" Another example is \"Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities (FASED),\" as described in Chapter II.E.6 of the NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide (PAPPG). Funding of supplements described in this DCL is subject to the availability of funds.","total_funding_limit":60000,"img_url":"https://sdat-dev.github.io/resources/studentfunding/assets/logos-funding-opportunities/dfmapsn.png"},{"applicant_type":["Undergraduate Student"],"contact":"Mrs. Rachel Eustace","contact_email":"Rachel@pathologists.org.uk","contact_tel":"01273 775700","deadline_date":null,"deadline_note":"Applications for a 2023 ACP Student Research Fund Award can be submitted at any time.","eligibility":"<p>The ACP Student Research Fund is open to applications from undergraduate medical students (sponsored by ACP members if possible). <br /></p>","id":"019638","NextDeadlineDate":null,"programurl":"https://pathologists.org.uk/awards/acp-student-research-fund-2021/","prog_title":"Student Research Fund Award","revision_date":"12-May-2023","sponsor_type":"Miscellaneous Non-Federal","sponwebsite":"https://pathologists.org.uk/awards/","spon_name":"Association of Clinical Pathologists","synopsis":"<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"></span>The Association of Clinical Pathologists is keen to encourage undergraduates to undertake some research within laboratory medicine, to raise the profile of laboratory medicine within the minds of undergraduates and to aid in recruitment of young graduates.&nbsp;Nine awards of up to &pound;5,000 are available, and priority will be given to those seeking funding to support an intercalated degree.<span style=\"color:#212529;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:small;font-style:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:#ffffff;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial;display:inline !important;float:none;\"></span></p>","total_funding_limit":6050,"img_url":"https://sdat-dev.github.io/resources/studentfunding/assets/logos-funding-opportunities/aocp.png"},{"applicant_type":["Undergraduate Student"],"contact":null,"contact_email":"osgc@oai.org","contact_tel":"440-962-3032","deadline_date":null,"deadline_note":"Proposals are accepted at any time.&nbsp;","eligibility":"<p>A faculty mentor is required.

Hence, the Board encourages applicants to consider feasibility of their request, that is, what they can achieve for this amount of money, and also to think about this type of award as supporting the beginning stages of a research project, the gathering of pilot data, or the refinement of design and methods.

Fostering diversity by addressing underrepresentation in the scientific research workforce is a key component of the NIH strategy to identify, develop, support and maintain the quality of our scientific human capital. In spite of tremendous advancements in scientific research, information, educational and research opportunities are not equally available to all. NIH encourages institutions to diversify their student, postdoctorate and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups identified as underrepresented in the biomedical sciences (e.g., see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html\">Notice of NIH's of Interest in Diversity</a>). For the purpose of this announcement, institutions are strongly encouraged to identify candidates who will enhance diversity on a national basis. In addition, it is recognized that underrepresentation can vary from setting to setting; individuals from racial or ethnic groups that can be demonstrated convincingly to be underrepresented by the grantee institution should be encouraged to participate in this program.</span></span></span></span></p></div></span><span style=\"color:#333333;font-size:small;\"><strong><br /></strong></span></div><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"></span>","id":"112701","NextDeadlineDate":"31-Jan-2024","programurl":"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-22-220.html","prog_title":"Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP)(R25 - Independent Clinical Trial Not Allowed)","revision_date":"22-Nov-2022","sponsor_type":"US Federal","sponwebsite":null,"spon_name":"National Institute of General Medical Sciences/NIH/DHHS","synopsis":"<div data-index=\"14\"><div><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">The NIH Research Education Program (R25) supports research education activities in the mission areas of the NIH.&nbsp; The overarching goal of this&nbsp;R25 program is to support educational activities that encourage individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from groups underrepresented in the biomedical and behavioral sciences, to pursue further studies or careers in research&nbsp;</span></p></div></div><div data-index=\"15\"><div tabindex=\"0\" data-element-id=\"119514\" data-element-required=\"true\" data-element-has-value=\"true\" data-section-code=\"OI\" data-element-type=\"TEXT\"></div><div><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">To accomplish the stated over-arching goal, this FOA will support creative educational activities with a primary focus on:</span></p></div></div><div data-index=\"16\"><div tabindex=\"0\" data-element-id=\"119515\" data-element-required=\"true\" data-element-has-value=\"true\" data-section-code=\"OI\" data-element-type=\"CHECKBOX\"></div><div><ul><li><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><strong><em>Courses for Skills Development</em></strong></span></li></ul><ul><li><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><strong><em>Research Experiences</em></strong></span></li></ul></div></div><div data-index=\"17\"><div tabindex=\"0\" data-element-id=\"119516\" data-element-required=\"false\" data-element-has-value=\"true\" data-section-code=\"OI\" data-element-type=\"TEXT\"></div><div><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) provides support to eligible, domestic institutions to develop and implement effective, evidence-informed approaches to biomedical research education and mentoring that will keep pace with the rapid evolution of the research enterprise.

General descriptions of the selection process and research plan taken verbatim from the T32 application are&nbsp;<strong>not acceptable</strong>. Because NCCIH-funded T32 programs were found to be highly meritorious by peer review, the quality of the overall training program and the other mentors will not be reevaluated during the supplement review process. Therefore, detailed descriptions of the general training program and the biosketches of other T32 mentors&nbsp;<strong>should not</strong>&nbsp;be included in the supplement application.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><strong>Review Criteria</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">The supplement materials will be subject to administrative review by NCCIH extramural staff.

The quality of their academic record (if predoctoral) and prior research experience and productivity; and 2.) Their potential to develop as an independent and productive researcher in biomedical, behavioral, or clinical science, as demonstrated in the training plan. These two aspects should be of roughly the same quality as those of other trainees at the same level who were awarded T32 slots in a particular program. The overall individual training plan, including coursework, research experiences, and the opportunity to build career skills needed for independent research, will be evaluated for its ability to provide the complementary and integrative health practitioner candidate with opportunities to become part of the broader scientific community and develop into an independent and productive research scientist. The research plan will be evaluated for: 1.) Its fit with the mission priorities of NCCIH; 2.) Its fit with the complementary and integrative health practitioner candidate&rsquo;s stated career goals and future plans; and 3.) Its consistency with the complementary and integrative health practitioner candidate&rsquo;s stage of research development.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><strong>Additional Criteria for Selection</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">Due to budget constraints, only a very limited number of T32 complementary and integrative health practitioner Supplement slots will be awarded in a given fiscal year. NCCIH program staff will evaluate the applications using the requested materials and evaluation process described above, in addition to the following criteria:</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">1. Are the program&rsquo;s T32 slots consistently filled with high quality trainees?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">2. Does the T32 program have an outstanding overall record of training predoctoral and/or postdoctoral trainees for successful research careers?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">After review by NCCIH program staff, the T32 PI will be notified of the funding decision. If funding is approved, a supplemental Notice of Award will be issued by Grants Management. The complementary and integrative health practitioner supplemental slot will be administered in the same manner as other positions on the training grant.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><strong>Reporting Requirements</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">Progress for complementary and integrative health practitioner trainees supported via this mechanism must be reported in the same way as all other trainees in a Type 5 non-competing continuation application each year that the supplement is needed. The progress and plans of the candidate should be explained in a paragraph or two of text in the body of the progress report. The stipends for these complementary and integrative health practitioner slots should not be included in the budget pages for the Type 5 application because these funds will be awarded as a supplement each year. Instead, a separate budget page for the complementary and integrative health practitioner candidate should be included in the progress report. An individual supported by a complementary and integrative health practitioner supplement slot must be included in the usual reporting tables required for renewal (Type 2) as well as non-competing continuation (Type 5) applications.</span></p></div><div data-element-id=\"17883\" data-element-has-label=\"false\" data-element-required=\"true\" data-element-has-value=\"true\" data-section-code=\"OI\" data-element-type=\"TEXT\"><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">Description of circumstances for which administrative supplements are available.</span></p></div><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">All requests for supplemental slots should be preceded by consultation with NCCIH program staff to determine availability of funds and to ascertain the suitability of the candidate.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><strong>Application and Submission Information</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">Applications for this initiative must be submitted using the following opportunity or its subsequent reissued equivalent.</span></p><ul><li><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\"><a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-20-272.html\">PA-20-272</a>&nbsp;- Administrative Supplements to Existing NIH Grants and Cooperative Agreements (Parent Admin Supp Clinical Trial Optional)</span></span></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">All instructions in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide.html\">SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-20-272.html\">PA-20-272</a>&nbsp;must be followed, with the following additions:</span></span></p><ul><li><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">For funding consideration, applicants must include &ldquo;NOT-AT-21-014&rdquo; (without quotation marks) in the Agency Routing Identifier field (box 4B) of the SF424 R&amp;R form.
