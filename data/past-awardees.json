When I learned about all the benefits he was getting, such as a summer internship and guaranteed full-time employment after graduation, I knew I had to apply for it since I was eligible.  So, I submitted an application with the help from this other student as well as my advisor and fortunately had success. I appreciate the independence, flexibility, and financial support brought to me by my fellowship. Since my PhD  is  funded by my own grant, I can completely define my research based on my interests, yet, I still have the support from my advisor and PhD committee."},{"Award":"NSF GRFP","LastName":"Findlay","FirstName":"Ernesto","FieldofStudy":"Geosciences - Climate and Large-Scale Atmospheric Dynamics","Email":"efindlay@albany.edu","Photo":"findlay-ernesto","ReceivedYear":2016,"FundingAmount":"$46,000 each year"},{"Award":"NSF GRFP","LastName":"Massmann","FirstName":"Adam Kimball","FieldofStudy":"Geosciences - Physical and Dynamic Meteorology","Email":"akm2203@columbia.edu","Photo":"massmann-adam-kimball","ReceivedYear":2015,"FundingAmount":"$46,000 each year"},{"Award":"NIH F31-Pre-Doctoral Fellowship","LastName":"Blatt","FirstName":"Patrick","FieldofStudy":"Regulated RNA degradation is required for Drosophila oogenesis","Email":"pblatt@albany.edu","Photo":"blatt-patrick","ReceivedYear":2017,"FundingAmount":57224},{"Award":"NIH F31-Pre-Doctoral Fellowship","LastName":"Louis","FirstName":"Marissa Eileen","FieldofStudy":"RNA structures regulating Zika virus gene expression","Email":"melouis@albany.edu","Photo":"louis-marissa-eileen","ReceivedYear":2018,"FundingAmount":72560,"Testimony":"I initially applied for a ton of fellowships. For this NIH Fellowship, this was the second time I applied when I got it. The most challenging part of my application was grant writing. I think the checklist on this website will be super helpful because I remembered missing pages and required components when I submitted my proposal to the Research Administrator for review, and I had to fill in the gaps right before final submission.\r\nThe most significant benefit of winning this NIH Fellowship for me was the independence, where I wasn't relying on my department to pay my salary. So, I had the freedom outside of teaching to just do research. In addition, it was great name recognition, something you could put on your CV. So later on, if I want to apply for an F32 fellowship, I could say I previously won an F31."},{"Award":"NIH F31-Pre-Doctoral Fellowship","LastName":"Wemm","FirstName":"Stephanie","FieldofStudy":"The impact of stress on steroid hormones and cue reactivity in smokers and gamblers","Email":"swemm@albany.edu","Photo":"wemm-stephanie","ReceivedYear":2015,"FundingAmount":45542},{"Award":"NIH F32-Post Doc Fellowship","LastName":"Desantis","FirstName":"Kara","FieldofStudy":"Exploring Interactions Between Retinoid and Vitamin D Signaling in Salivary Gland Homeostasis and Cancer","Email":"kadesantis@albany.edu","Photo":"desantis-kara","ReceivedYear":2018,"FundingAmount":121864,"Testimony":"Generally, if you're in an NIH-supported lab, you're encouraged to apply for NIH funding because your chances of being funded are higher when you are in an NIH-supported lab. So, in my case, when I was a doctoral student, my PI encouraged me to apply to the NIH for postdoctoral support, and that's how I ended up doing that. Besides the independence of research, having financial security and knowing that you have a secured salary is really nice, since lab funding cycles can lapse in between grants. If your lab has a lapse in funding, there's that moment of insecurity when you're not sure if you're going to have the funding to continue your project. But on a fellowship, you have a salary in place and if you need to you can cobble together the supplies you need to continue the projects that you're working on."},{"Award":"NIH F32-Post Doc Fellowship","LastName":"Lennon","FirstName":"Christopher William","FieldofStudy":"Post-translational regulation of recombinase function by intein splicing","Email":"clennon1@murraystate.edu","Photo":"lennon-christopher-william","ReceivedYear":2016,"FundingAmount":118992},{"Award":"NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Awards","LastName":"Li","FirstName":"Muyang","FieldofStudy":"Negotiation between State and Individuals through Social Media","Email":"mli2@albany.edu","Photo":"li-muyang","ReceivedYear":2019,"FundingAmount":14831,"Testimony":"I am an awardee of the 2019 NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Awards.
