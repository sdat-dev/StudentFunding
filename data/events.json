You will have an opportunity to begin sketching out a plan for using those principles and be invited to work further on your teaching statement with an ITLAL consultant.","image":"hat_on_books.png"},{"Title":"Virtual Meet Up - General Questions","Purpose":"","When":"Friday, October 30 from 11:00am - 12:00pm","Where":"Online","Link":"https://admissions.albany.edu/register/MeetUp-Oct30","Description":"Join our current graduate students and other prospective students to learn more about graduate programs at UAlbany and get your questions answered about life as a graduate student.","image":"hat_on_books.png"},{"Title":"Searching for Non-Academic Careers","Purpose":"","When":"Tuesday, November 3 from 12:00pm - 1:00pm","Where":"Online","Link":"https://admissions.albany.edu/register/NonAcademicCareerF20a","Description":"Are you a Ph.D. student (or Master’s student) considering an “alternative” or non-academic career path?
